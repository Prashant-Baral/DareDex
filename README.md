# 🎯 DareDex – A College Dare Exchange Platform

**DareDex** is a fun, multipage web application built using **Django**, designed to allow college students to post, accept, and complete dares in a gamified environment. This project was developed as part of my full-stack learning journey with Django and reflects my interest in creating data-powered web applications in the future.
